talk about TVM

Implement TVH : why not multiply by number of hours ?

How do I get contour plot of pems data to compare (and for congestion pattern)
/are flw and occ smoothened ? Oo
/ 288 in pems5data => pb if duration different than one day ?
/ use real scenario instead of "matching beats" scenario now 


Pb with several sensors in one link in pems "unique..."=> errors in TVM and others maybe => I checked, two sensors on a same link have different values ex : columns 3-45, 64-66, 63-67.

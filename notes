talk about TVM

Implement TVH : why not multiply by number of hours ?

How do I get contour plot of pems data to compare (and for congestion pattern)
/are flw and occ smoothened ? Oo
/ 288 in pems5data => pb if duration different than one day ?
/ use real scenario instead of "matching beats" scenario now 


Pb with several sensors in one link in pems "unique..."=> errors in TVM and others maybe => I checked, two sensors on a same link have different values ex : columns 3-45, 64-66, 63-67.

TVM/TVH too global to tune 11 knobs precisely : take into account local variations ? 

why don't I compare with the actual congestion instead of a square ? I define a rectangle, and then compare pems congestion with beats congestion in it.
criteria for density treshold+epsilon
equilibrium popsize/time

 %CHECK THAT MONITORED TEMPLATES ARE THE EXACT SAME AS PEMS DATA.
    %I AM USING BEATS OUTPUT WITH KNOBS SET TO ONE INSTEAD OF TEMPLATES FOR
    %REFINING THE KNOB BOUNDARIES (IN THEORY, THEIR SUM SHOULD BE THE
    %SAME).
    %IS THERE A WAY TO RUN BEATS PERSISTENT WHITHOUT RESETING ? ITS SO
    %FAST.
    
    fix the zeros not smoothened in PeMS data


    implement powers to the error functions
    implement exporting variablescmaes.mat to the right place everytime
